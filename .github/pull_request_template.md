> * Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR.
> * Before creating your PR, please ensure you read the [branching strategy](/docs/branching-strategy.md). The end result after completing the merge actions should be that `release/XXX <= develop`, where `XXX` is the latest released protocol version. This ensures that we minimise merge conflicts, and that work doesn't go missing.
> * As per the branching strategy, **you must ensure you select the _correct base branch_**, both for branching from, and in the PR UI above. The following process can be used to decide the base branch:
>   * For README changes or code changes which can wait until the next protocol update to be released, use `develop`. This should be the default for code changes.
>   * For github workflow changes, or code changes which need to go out as a fully-interoperable update to the node at the current protocol version, use `release/XXX`.
>     * Such changes must be tested and reviewed more carefully to mitigate the risk of regression.
>     * Once the change is merged, it is the merger's responsibility to ensure `release/XXX` is merged into the `develop` branch.

## Changelog

<!--
> [!TIP]
>
> If the change in your PR is a new feature, or could affect or break any API integrators, then it likely will need an update to the CHANGELOG.md file.
>
> After making any required updates, write either of these two:
> * "The changelog has been updated to capture XX changes which affect XX"
> * "The changelog was not updated because this change has no user-facing impact"

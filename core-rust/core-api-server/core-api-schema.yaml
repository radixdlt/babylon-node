# NOTES TO EDITORS:
#
# Guidance for integer types (see https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#numbers)
#
# => If a u8, use type: integer, format: int32, minimum: 0, maximum: 255
# => If an i8, use type: integer, format: int32, minimum: -128, maximum: 127 (also, why are you using an i8!?)
# => If a u32:
#    => If there's a domain-imposed requirement that fits it within an i32 (2,147,483,647 = 2^31 - 1), with bound B use
#       type: integer, format: int32, minimum: 0, maximum: B
#       And be sure to validate against B in the code which maps into the type. See EG epoch max length in numerics.rs
#    => If not, to be compatible with OAS, we need to put it into an int64:
#       type: integer, format: int64, minimum: 0, maximum: 4294967295 = 2^32 - 1
# => If an i32, use type: integer, format: int32
# => If a u64: , use type: integer, format: int64, minimum: 0, maximum: 18446744073709551615 = 2^64 - 1
#    => If there's a domain-imposed requirement that fits it within an i64 (9,223,372,036,854,775,807 = 2^63 - 1), with bound B use
#       type: integer, format: int64, minimum: 0, maximum: B
#       And be sure to validate against B in the code which maps into the type. See EG epoch max length in numerics.rs
#    => If not, to be compatible with OAS, it won't fit in a numeric type, so use a string instead
# => If an i64, use type: integer, format: int64
# => If something over i64/u64, use type: string
#
# Regardless of the type, specify in the description what the underlying type and bounds are, by starting with something like:
# - An integer between 0 and 10^10, giving
# - A decimal-string-encoded integer between 0 and 2^64 - 1, which
# - A decimal-string-encoded integer between 0 and 10^123, that
#
# Descriptions guidance:
# => For descriptions of encoded types, we follow this pattern: 'The xyz-encoded, abc-encoded xx of the yy'
#    EG 'The hex-encoded, SBOR-encoded data' or 'The hex-encoded double-SHA256 hash of the banana payload'
# => Don't end in a full-stop, unless it is more than 1 sentence, then all sentences should end in a full stop
# => It's not technically valid to have both $ref and description, but it works in ReDocly, so feel free to do it

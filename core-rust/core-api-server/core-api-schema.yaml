# NOTES TO EDITORS:
#
# Guidance for integer types (see https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#numbers)
#
# => If a u8, use type: integer, format: int32, minimum: 0, maximum: 255
# => If an i8, use type: integer, format: int32, minimum: -128, maximum: 127 (also, why are you using an i8!?)
# => If a u32:
#    => If there's a domain-imposed requirement that fits it within an i32 (2,147,483,647 = 2^31 - 1), with bound B use
#         type: integer
#         format: int32
#         minimum: 0
#         maximum: B
#       And be sure to validate against B in the code which maps into the type. See EG epoch max length in numerics.rs
#    => If not, to be compatible with OAS, we need to put it into an int64:
#         type: integer
#         format: int64
#         minimum: 0
#         maximum: 4294967295
# => If an i32, use type: integer, format: int32
# => If a u64:
#    => The maximum safe integer in Javascript is (+-)2^53 – 1 = 9,007,199,254,740,991 ~ 9 * 10^15
#       To be pragmatic, any numbers outside this range we will choose to represent as strings.
#    => So if it's possible for us to assert that: value <= bound B <= 2^53 - 1, then use:
#       type: integer, format: int64, minimum: 0, maximum: B
#       And be sure to validate against B in the code which maps into the type. See EG epoch max length in numerics.rs
#    => If not, use a string instead
# => If an i64:
#    => The maximum safe integer in Javascript is (+-)2^53 – 1 = 9,007,199,254,740,991 ~ 9 * 10^15
#       To be pragmatic, any numbers outside this range we will choose to represent as strings.
#    => So if it's possible for us to assert that: -(2^53 - 1) <= B1 <= value <= B2 <= 2^53 - 1, then use:
#         type: integer
#         format: int64
#         minimum: B1
#         maximum: B2
#       And be sure to validate against B in the code which maps into the type. See EG epoch max length in numerics.rs
#    => If not, use a string instead
# => If something over i64/u64, use type: string
#
# Regardless of the type, specify in the description what the underlying type and bounds are, by starting with something like:
# - An integer between 0 and 10^10, giving
# - A decimal-string-encoded integer between 0 and 2^64 - 1, which
# - A decimal-string-encoded integer between 0 and 10^123, that
#
# Descriptions guidance:
# => For descriptions of encoded types, we follow this pattern: 'The xyz-encoded, abc-encoded xx of the yy'
#    EG 'The hex-encoded, SBOR-encoded data' or 'The hex-encoded Blake2b-256 hash of the banana payload'
# => Don't end in a full-stop, unless it is more than 1 sentence, then all sentences should end in a full stop
# => It's not technically valid to have both $ref and description, but it works in ReDocly, so feel free to do it
#
# Naming guidance:
# => Hex-encoded hashes should end _hash
# => Hex-encoded bytes/payload should end _hex and not include _bytes

  # Should be the release version, and the release display name

    This API is exposed by the Babylon Radix node to give clients access to the Radix Engine, Mempool and State in the node.

    The default configuration is intended for use by node-runners on a private network, and is not intended to be exposed publicly.
    Very heavy load may impact the node's function. The node exposes a configuration flag which allows disabling certain endpoints
    which may be problematic, but monitoring is advised. This configuration parameter is
    `api.core.flags.enable_unbounded_endpoints` / `RADIXDLT_CORE_API_FLAGS_ENABLE_UNBOUNDED_ENDPOINTS`.

    This API exposes queries against the node's current state (see `/lts/state/` or `/state/`), and streams of transaction history
    (under `/lts/stream/` or `/stream`).

    If you require queries against snapshots of historical ledger state, you may also wish to consider using the
    [Gateway API](https://docs-babylon.radixdlt.com/).

    ## Integration and forward compatibility guarantees

    Integrators (such as exchanges) are recommended to use the `/lts/` endpoints - they have been designed to be clear
    and simple for integrators wishing to create and monitor transactions involving fungible transfers to/from accounts.

    All endpoints under `/lts/` have high guarantees of forward compatibility in future node versions.
    We may add new fields, but existing fields will not be changed. Assuming the integrating code uses a permissive
    JSON parser which ignores unknown fields, any additions will not affect existing code.

    Other endpoints may be changed with new node versions carrying protocol-updates, although any breaking changes
    will be flagged clearly in the corresponding release notes.

    All responses may have additional fields added, so clients are advised to use JSON parsers which ignore unknown
    fields on JSON objects.

      Interacting with this API effectively may require knowledge about the Radix Babylon Transaction Model and the State Model.

      We share some very high-level details below, but please see the [official documentation](http://docs.radixdlt.com) for more details on this.

      ## Transactions

      User transactions are formed of a core "intent", which is then signed by 0+ signatories, before being notarized. The output is called a notarized payload.
      It is this notarized transaction payload which is submitted to the network.
      
      For most users, this construction process will generally happen in their Radix Wallet. If you wish to construct transactions programmatically or offline,
      you will need to integrate the Radix Engine Toolkit into your application for construction and finalization.

      Once submitted, a transaction payload can end up being either rejected or committed. Transactions get rejected if they fail to pass certain criteria at the given time.
      A transaction payload can be marked as a:
      - **Permanent Rejection** if it is never possible for it to be committed (eg it's statically invalid, or only valid up until epoch 100 and it's now epoch 101)
      - **Temporary Rejection** if it still may be possible that the transaction payload could be committed

      A given intent typically is only part of one submitted notarized payload, but it's possible for a notary to notarize and submit multiple payloads for the same intent.
      The Radix Engine ensures that any intent can only be committed once.

      A committed transaction is either committed with an outcome of "Success" or "Failure":
      - **Committed Failure** will result in fees being paid up until the failure point, but all other changes will be discarded.
      - **Committed Success** will result in all changes being committed.

      Only committed transactions appear on ledger. The status of rejected transactions can be read at submission time or from the transaction status endpoint - by virtue of
      a rejection cache on the node. This cache is limited in size, so rejected statuses may no longer be tracked after a period of time.

      For a more robust handling of transaction rejections, consider running your own Gateway.

      ## State Model

      The Radix Engine State Model can be thought of as a forest of state sub-trees.
      A state sub-tree consists of "entities". These entities have an ID, and 0 or more "substates" at keys underneath them. 
      These substates are typed, and can own other entities, forming a tree of ownership.

      Each state sub-tree has a root entity, and a single Bech32M Global Address, with a human-readable-prefix (and prefix byte) matching the root entity type.

      As an example, entities include concepts like Components, Packages, Vaults, Resource Managers and Key-Value Stores.
      Substates under a component include the Component Struct, Component Data, and Access Rules substates.

      To construct and submit a transaction using the LTS endpoints:

      * Query `/lts/transaction/construction` to retrieve the current epoch (according to your node).
        Check also that the `ledger_clock` is close to the current time - this ensures that the node is synced up.
      * Make use of the Radix Engine Toolkit to construct the intent, sign/notarize, and compile the notarized transaction.
      * You can use `/lts/transaction/submit` to submit the transaction
      * Use `/lts/transaction/status` to check the status of the transaction
      * Use `/lts/stream/transaction-outcomes` to look up the outcome of the transaction, from its state version

        AES-KeyWrap uses a key derived via a KDF (Key Derivation Function) using a shared secret.
        For each decryptor public key, we create a shared curve point `G` via static Diffie-Helman between the decryptor public key, and a per-transaction ephemeral public key for that curve type.
        We then use that shared secret with a key derivation function to create the (256-bit) KEK (Key Encrypting Key):
        `KEK = HKDF(hash: Blake2b, secret: x co-ord of G, salt: [], length: 256 bits)`.

                Note that, even if validation mode is Static or Full, the transaction may
                still be rejected or fail due to issues at runtime (eg if the loan cannot be repaid).

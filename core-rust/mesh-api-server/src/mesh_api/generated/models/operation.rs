/// Operation : Operations contain all balance-changing information within a transaction. They are always one-sided (only affect 1 AccountIdentifier) and can succeed or fail independently from a Transaction.  Operations are used both to represent on-chain data (Data API) and to construct new transactions (Construction API), creating a standard interface for reading and writing to blockchains.

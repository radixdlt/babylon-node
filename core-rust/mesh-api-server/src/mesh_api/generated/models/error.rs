/// Error : Instead of utilizing HTTP status codes to describe node errors (which often do not have a good analog), rich errors are returned using this object.

In many cases, the content of this field will be a copy-and-paste from existing developer documentation.  Description can ONLY be populated with generic information about a particular type of error. It MUST NOT be populated with information about a particular instantiation of an error (use `details` for this).  Whereas the content of Error.Message should stay stable across releases, the content of Error.Description will likely change across releases (as implementers improve error documentation). For this reason, the content in this field is not part of any type assertion (unlike Error.Message).

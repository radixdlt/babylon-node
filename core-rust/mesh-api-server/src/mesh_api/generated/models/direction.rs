/// Direction : Used by RelatedTransaction to indicate the direction of the relation (i.e. cross-shard/cross-network sends may reference `backward` to an earlier transaction and async execution may reference `forward`). Can be used to indicate if a transaction relation is from child to parent or the reverse.

  Blocks contain an array of Transactions that
  occurred at a particular BlockIdentifier.

  A hard requirement for blocks returned by Rosetta
  implementations is that they MUST be _inalterable_:
  once a client has requested and received
  a block identified by a specific BlockIndentifier,
  all future calls for that same BlockIdentifier
  must return the same block contents.

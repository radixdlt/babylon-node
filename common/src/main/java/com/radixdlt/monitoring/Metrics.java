/**
 * An entry point to metrics tracked by the Java part of the Node application.
 *
 * <p>We use the official <a href="https://github.com/prometheus/client_java">Prometheus client</a>,
 * directly referencing its measurement primitives and our light wrappers (i.e. we don't hide
 * Prometheus' presence from our business logic).
 *
 * <p>The record hierarchy represents different sub-systems and services, and the leafs are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Counter}: a Prometheus-native up/down counter. Its name should be a plural noun
 *       describing the things being counted (e.g. "parsingErrors").
 *   <li>{@link Gauge}: a Prometheus-native indicator of an arbitrarily changing value. Its name
 *       should be a noun describing the value - may be singular (e.g. "versionNumber") or plural
 *       (e.g. "activeClients").
 *   <li>{@link GetterGauge}: our getter-based counterpart of the {@link Gauge}, for which a direct
 *       "sample provider" needs to be {@link GetterGauge#initialize(DoubleSupplier) initialized}.
 *       <b>Note:</b> such approach goes against Prometheus' conventions, and we only use it in
 *       legacy cases (which could not be easily migrated to regular "{@link Gauge} update" style).
 *   <li>{@link Timer}: our duration-specific wrapper for a {@link Summary} without quantiles. It
 *       effectively represents a pair of [occurrence count, cumulative elapsed seconds],
 *       appropriate for tracking an average latency of an operation. Its name should be a verb
 *       describing the performed operation (e.g. "saveState").
 *   <li>{@link LabelledCounter}: our type-safe wrapper for a {@link Counter} with labels (i.e. to
 *       be used instead of Prometheus-native typo-prone {@link Counter#labels(String...)}.
 *   <li>{@link LabelledGauge}: our type-safe wrapper for a {@link Gauge} with labels (i.e. to be
 *       used instead of Prometheus-native typo-prone {@link Gauge#labels(String...)}.
 *   <li>{@link LabelledTimer}: type-safe labels support for our {@link Timer}.
 *   <li>{@link TypedInfo}: our type-safe wrapper for a special information-only metric, to be
 *       always used instead of the raw Prometheus-native {@link Info}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Any leaf may be annotated as {@link NotExposed}, if we wish to keep it around, but exclude it
 * from the exposition endpoint - please see the annotation's javadoc for motivation.
 *
 * <p>The type-safe labels mentioned above are implemented using {@link Record}s - we {@link
 * NameRenderer#labelNames(Class) render the record component's name as label name} (converting it
 * {@link NameRenderer#render(String) to Prometheus' format} on the way), and we use the plain
 * {@link Object#toString()} for the label's value.
 *
 * <p>For a complete example, suppose that we have a metric field definition:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   public record Metrics(...) {
 *
 *     public record Crypto(
 *        LabelledCounter<SignDetails> signErrors
 *     ) {}
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     public record SignDetails(String signedBy, SignType type) {}
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If we bump it like:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Metrics.crypto().signErrors().label(new SignDetails("Verifier 1", SignType.SHA_256)).inc(3);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Then the exposition endpoint will return:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   rn_crypto_sign_errors{signed_by="Verifier 1",type="SHA_256",} 3.0
 * </pre>
 *
 * (the "rn_" is a prefix identifying our application, just for convenience)
 *
 * <p>The concrete record label definitions for our metrics are defined at the end of this class.
